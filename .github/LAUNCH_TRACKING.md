# Launch Readiness Project Board Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up GitHub project boards and milestones to track launch-critical issues.

## 📋 Milestone Creation

Create the following milestone in GitHub:

**Milestone: Launch Readiness**
- **Title:** Launch Readiness - September 15, 2025
- **Due Date:** September 15, 2025
- **Description:** All issues required for successful Day 1 public launch of the DESIST platform

## 🗂️ Project Board Setup

Create a GitHub project board with the following columns:

### Column Structure
1. **📥 Backlog** - Issues identified but not yet started
2. **🏗️ In Progress** - Issues currently being worked on
3. **👀 Review** - Issues pending review or approval
4. **🧪 Testing** - Issues in testing phase
5. **✅ Done** - Completed and verified issues

### Board Automation Rules
- Move issues to "In Progress" when assigned
- Move to "Review" when PR is opened
- Move to "Testing" when PR is merged to staging
- Move to "Done" when issue is closed

## 🏷️ Label System

Create the following labels for issue categorization:

### Priority Labels
- `launch-critical` (red) - Must be completed for launch
- `priority-high` (orange) - Important but not blocking
- `priority-medium` (yellow) - Nice to have for launch
- `priority-low` (green) - Post-launch consideration

### Category Labels
- `authentication` (blue) - SSO and auth-related issues
- `security` (red) - Security and privacy issues
- `performance` (purple) - Speed and optimization
- `accessibility` (green) - A11y compliance issues
- `infrastructure` (gray) - DevOps and deployment
- `documentation` (yellow) - Docs and support materials
- `legal` (brown) - Legal and compliance issues
- `testing` (orange) - QA and testing issues

### Platform Labels
- `website` (blue) - Web platform specific
- `mobile-app` (green) - Mobile app specific
- `cross-platform` (purple) - Affects both platforms

is:issue milestone:"Launch Readiness" label:launch-critical is:closed
```

### Issues by Category
```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Daily Standup Template
- What launch-critical issues were completed yesterday?
- What launch-critical issues are planned for today?
- Are there any blockers preventing launch readiness?
- Is the team on track for the September 15 launch date?

### Weekly Review Template
- How many launch-critical issues remain?
- Are we on track for the launch timeline?
- What risks have been identified this week?
- Do we need to adjust scope or timeline?

## 🚨 Escalation Process

### When to Escalate
- Any launch-critical issue blocked for >24 hours
- Discovery of new critical issues <7 days before launch
- Any issue that may delay the launch date
- Security vulnerabilities discovered during testing

### Escalation Chain
1. **Technical Lead** - For technical blockers
2. **Product Manager** - For scope or priority decisions
3. **Engineering Manager** - For resource allocation
4. **CTO/CEO** - For timeline or budget decisions

**Remember:** The launch date is firm. If critical issues can't be resolved in time, we must have fallback plans or reduce scope rather than delay the launch.
